#Geoportal issues 

- **Error identification:** station discharge-buren-tolgoi has wrong GPS coordinates!
This station is managed by Mongolian Authority under the name Kharaa-Darkhan (We suggest to use this name!)
The correct GPS coordinates are: 49,5914167°N 105,8591167°E

- **Metadata handling:** Where should we enter the metadata for the uploaded shapefiles? Is the GeoNetwork instance for the geoportal still in use or do you suggest a different solution?

- **Raster data handling:** How should we deal with raster data (like satellite or UAS imagery)? Can we (IGB/HTW) upload this to a server at your side (terrestris)?

- **Water Quality Database:** The water quality monitoring data (MOMO1/MOMO2) for nutrients, heavy metals and physical parameters of surface and ground water collected by IGB, UFZ, FhAST and others is available in MS ACCESS format. Is it technically possible to upload the database to the geoportal in this format (for direct download and potentially for integration in the geoportal user interface)? This also has to be discussed and decided in the project consortium beforehand.
